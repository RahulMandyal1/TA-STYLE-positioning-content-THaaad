                        in our aurban and surbuan  house what should be do without cats? in
                        our sitting bedrooms, our libraries, in our kitchen ,our storerooms,
                        our farms ,barns,rickyards,in our docks, our granaries,our sheeps
                        ,our wraves,in our corn markets, meat markets and other places too
                        neumerous  to mention how useful they are! in our ships. the rats 
                        oft sets them at defilance  still they are of great service.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>

                        How wonderfully patient is the cat when
                         watching for rats or mice, awaiting their
                          egress from their place of refuge or that 
                          which is their home! How well Shakespeare 
                          in Pericles, Act ill., describes this keen attention 
                          of the cat to its natural pursuit!
                          <br>
                          
                        <span>
                         The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
                        Now crouches from (before) the mouse's hole.
                       </span>
                       <br>

                       A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes forth;
                        a quick, sharp, resolute motion, and the cat has
                         proved its usefulness. Let anyone have a pluge of rats and
                         mice, as once i had, and let them delivered therefrom by cats
                         as i was and they will had a lasting and king regard for thems
