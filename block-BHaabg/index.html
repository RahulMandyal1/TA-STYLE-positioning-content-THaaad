                        There's no better time to grab one of the best 5G phones,
                         as Black Friday phone deals give you the chance to save
                          on some of the best phones out there. And these days, 
                          it's more common for a phone to offer 5G support than
                          to ship without it — even in relatively inexpensive 
                          handsets.
                        Does that mean this is now the time to 
                        make your next phone a 5G-ready device?
                         While carriers are continuing to expand 
                         their 5G networks to boost speeds and
                          increase coverage, buying any new phone
                           likely means you're getting 5G 
                           compatibility — and potentially at a 
                           very attractive price.
